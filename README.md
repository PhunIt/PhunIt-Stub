PhunIt-Stub
=============

Overview
--------

This library tries to bring simple, flexible & definitive stubbing to PHP 5.3

Features
--------

+ Initialize your stubs from **existing objects** or *nothing at all*.
+ Define the stubbed behavior of just the methods you need. If your test case calls a non-stubbed method it will fallback to the real deal.
+ Simple, easy to read & fluid configuration interface.
+ Full code covered by unit-tests.

Planned Features
----------------

+ Configure the return of your stubbed methods depending on input parameters, custom conditions or whatever you need (using closures).
+ Fully namespaced PHP5.3 architecture

Examples
--------

Just take a look into any test to have an idea of PhunIt-Stub's capabilities
